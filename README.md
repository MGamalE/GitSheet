# GitSheet
This repo demonstrates the playing journey with  **`Git`** commands  :rocket:


# Getting Started 

Here we are sharing with you how to play with git commands :memo:, thoughts, challenges, resources, and other stuff that will be interested for you. :monocle_face: :bulb: :star:


# Introduction

### - 📅 History

 Before we dip into `Git`, we have to discuss an overview and history about version control. 

* 🗒️ In the 90's, Microsoft introduced VSS (Visual SourceSave).It’s a client/server system. The server stores a database of all project files together with the history of changes for these files

   > `VSS` allows you to manage multiple developers on the same project, by “checking out” a file from the server, so this process allows the developer    when working on a file to prevent changes from other developers till he makes a check out for this file.

 * 🗒️ After `VSS`, `SVN (SubVersion)` was launched as a version control system, and introduced a command line interface.

   > `SVN` tackling another issue called “Tree conflict”, that caused by a conflict when multiple developer working on the same directory,and SVN doesn’t allowed to commit with these conflicts 

* 🗒️ With `SVN` and `VSS`, Microsoft went ahead with a new version control, `TFS (Team Foundation Server)`, which enabled to work with `Checking out file system as  VSS`, or `Branching model as SVN`.

* 🗒️ In the meantime, `Git` was introduced with a powerful merging model, and as a  distributed version control, not like `VSS / SVN`  which working as a client/server system, so no need to be connected to a server.


#### 📝 Why is version control important ?
 
> It’s so important to keep everything in source control for delivery process, and a single source of truth.


- Keep tracking of changes
- Helps team collaborate 
- Working on versioning and history 
- Manage traceability , who/when do these changes


#### :file_folder: Types of changes on Git

- Add  file
- Delete file
- Edit file
- Rename file


#### :construction: When you get a conflict ?

* When multiple users trying to edit the same line in a file, as shown below 

	- User1 trying to add `½ tbsp cilantro`, and User2 trying to add `2 tbsp cilantro` in the same line
	- Or when User1 delete a file, User2 trying to edit/modify the same file
	- > So, you have to keep your files updated with latest changes from remote `GIT SERVER`
