# Introduction

### - 📅 History

 Before we dip into `Git`, we have to discuss an overview and history about version control. 

* 🗒️ In the 90's, Microsoft introduced VSS (Visual SourceSave).It’s a client/server system. The server stores a database of all project files together with the history of changes for these files

 > `VSS` allows you to manage multiple developers on the same project, by “checking out” a file from the server, so this process allows the developer when working on a file to prevent changes from other developers till he makes a check out for this file.

 * 🗒️ After `VSS`, `SVN (SubVersion)` was launched as a version control system, and introduced a command line interface.

 > `SVN` tackling another issue called “Tree conflict”, that caused by a conflict when multiple developer working on the same directory,and SVN doesn’t allowed to commit with these conflicts 

* 🗒️ With `SVN` and `VSS`, Microsoft went ahead with a new version control, `TFS (Team Foundation Server)`, which enabled to work with `Checking out file system as  VSS`, or `Branching model as SVN`.

* 🗒️ In the meantime, `Git` as introduced with a powerful merging model, and as a  distributed version control, not like `VSS / SVN`  which working as a client/server system, so no need to be connected to a server.
